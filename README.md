To Start off, I recommend attempting a login using one of your agent logins that we have created and to get a feel for things. If you run into issues or you cannot recall the password for an agent, you always have the ability to log back in with your admin account and within the Admin panel, you will be able to manage all agents, including the ability of changing the password. Next, it is now time to create some tickets. For this, go to the enduser portal, where tickets can be created. The default page for this should always be under http://localhost/osTicket/. Once there, you select "Open a new Ticket". now input the user info outlined in my previous tutrorial (name, email address). Now you will start to see the adjustments that have been made come into play. Choose from one of your help topics that you have created, or a default one. Then you can summaize the issue briefly and afterwards provide details that are neccessary regarding the issue. When finished, click "Create Ticket". You will receive a confimation.
