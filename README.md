To Start off, I recommend attempting a login using one of your agent logins that we have created and to get a feel for things. If you run into issues or you cannot recall the password for an agent, you always have the ability to log back in with your admin account and within the Admin panel, you will be able to manage all agents, including the ability of changing the password. Next, it is now time to create some tickets. For this, go to the enduser portal, where tickets can be created. The default page for this should always be under http://localhost/osTicket/. Once there, you select "Open a new Ticket". As mentioned in my previous tutorial, you will need to enter both the Name and email of the user now.
